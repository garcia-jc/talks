## The Go 1 promise of compatibility

When Go 1 was released in March 2012, it introduced a big commitment to developers: 
* If you write code for 1.x, future 1.y releases will compile your code
* If you use the standard library in Go 1.x, the API will be available in the future
* TL,DR: Once a new Go version is released, you can use it without code changes! ðŸ¤¯

* Go 1.21 - min,max,clear; fix loopvar declaration
* Go 1.22 - math/rand/v2, range over integers

## Updating from Go 1.5 to Go 1.22

## Either die as a hero or live long enough...

To work on a Java migration project.

* JRE 1.6 -> 8 (Optionals, Streams, Lambdas) (2015)
* JRE 8 -> 11 (Removing javax from JRE, Modules, Type inference) (2019)
* JRE 11 -> JRE 17 (Record types, Switch expressions, Text blocks) (2021)
* Python 2 vs Python 3 

Are those migration efforts that bad?
