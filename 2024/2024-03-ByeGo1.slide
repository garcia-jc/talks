## The Go 1 promise of compatibility

When Go 1 was released in March 2012, it introduced a big commitment to developers: 
* If you write code for 1.x, future 1.y releases will compile your code
* If you use the standard library in Go 1.x, the API will be available in the future
* TL,DR: Once a new Go version is released, you can use it without code changes! ðŸ¤¯
